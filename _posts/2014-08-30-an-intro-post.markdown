# An Intro...

## About Me

My name is Lydell. I've been messing around with computers for as long as I can remember. I have an interest in web app and web development, but I also like to dabble in game development. In fact, I co-own a indie game dev company.

My other interests include Music and video games. I've played drums since the age of 9, and I have a degree in Music Performance. I also like to mess around with electronic stuff! You can check it out at my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/llaverne">Soundcloud Page</a>.

## So... What Else?

I'm looking forward to blogging my experience learning and implement a number of languages and technologies. But I also will probably blog about my musical endeavors, as well! Why not, right?


On my list of things to try blogging with:
Python (For school! For Fun?)
JavaScript
Ruby
Obj-C
SDL using C/C++
